        Art Nouveau is a generalized name for various architectural styles of the late XIX - early XX century in Western Europe and Russia, which were united by the desire to move away from eclecticism: to get rid of the excesses and variegation of diverse decor typical of previous periods of historicism and the "Victorian style". There are a huge number of modern architecture monuments in St. Petersburg, you can\'t get around them in a day or two, but we tried to select the most iconic ones for you.
    </string>
    <string name="route_desc_2">
St. Petersburg is a real storehouse of monuments of pre-revolutionary architecture. But our city is not only made up of it. Today we would like to take you through the monuments of late Soviet architecture - Soviet modernism.
Soviet (or socialist) modernism is an architectural style that existed in the 1950s and 1990s in the countries of the socialist bloc. One of the three main directions of architecture of the USSR, along with the avant-garde and Stalinist neoclassicism. The transition to modernism was the resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the USSR Council of Ministers of 1955 "On the elimination of excesses in design and construction", which simultaneously ended the era of Stalinist neoclassicism. Almost all the outstanding buildings built in the post-war Soviet period in St. Petersburg were in this style.
    </string>
    <string name="route_desc_3">
The Stalinist Empire is the informal name of Stalinist neoclassicism, one of the leading trends in architecture, monumental and decorative art of the USSR from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s. The symbol of the Stalinist Empire is the famous Stalin skyscrapers in Moscow. The Stalinist Empire style in the decor of the premises is, in particular, massive wooden furniture, stucco molding under high ceilings, carved cabinets, bronze lamps and statuettes.
The end of the Stalin Empire era is considered to be the Resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR dated November 4, 1955 "On the elimination of excesses in design and construction."
In St. Petersburg, unlike Moscow, there are not so many outstanding representatives of this style, but we could not help but pay attention to such an important period of the architectural history of the twentieth century.

Bloody Sunday, which took place on January 9, 1905, was an important event in the history of the Russian Empire. On this day, thousands of workers and residents of St. Petersburg took to the streets to hold a peaceful demonstration in front of the Winter Palace, demanding political and social reforms.
However, the peaceful demonstration was brutally suppressed by the authorities. As the crowd approached the Winter Palace, armed soldiers opened fire on the protesters. A large number of people were killed or injured. This was a turning point in the history of Russia, which stimulated a further increase in protests and demands for changes.
Bloody Sunday became one of the key events of 1905, which is known as the "Revolutionary years 1905-1907". This wave of protests and strikes led to significant social and political changes in the Russian Empire. As a result, some reforms were undertaken, including the establishment of the State Duma and improved working conditions.
Bloody Sunday remains an important memorable event, recalling the struggle for freedom and human rights, as well as the need for political reforms and respect for civil liberties.

The military blockade of the city of Leningrad by German and Finnish troops and their allies during the Great Patriotic War. It lasted from September 8, 1941 to January 27, 1944 (the blockade ring was broken on January 18, 1943) — the blockade lasted 872 days, in some sources 871 days. In literature and on monuments, there is a rounding of 900 days and nights.
By the beginning of the blockade, there was not enough food and fuel in the city for a long siege. The only way to communicate with Leningrad was the route through Lake Ladoga, which was within reach of the artillery and aircraft of the besiegers, as well as the enemy naval forces operating on the lake. The capacity of this transport artery did not meet the needs of the city. As a result, the mass famine that began in Leningrad, aggravated by the particularly harsh first winter of the blockade, problems with heating and transport, led to hundreds of thousands of deaths among its residents.

And this route follows the places of that terrible period of history.

        The “Silver Age" is the period in the history of Russian culture dating back to the beginning of the XX century. The period was named after its completion. It was considered the second heyday of Russian culture after the “Golden Age” (the Pushkin era of the early 19th century). During this period, the intelligentsia shifted its attention from socio-political issues to mystical and spiritual ones, which gave rise to new trends in philosophy. Many new trends were developing in painting, and artists staged scandalous exhibitions one after another. But perhaps the most famous is the poetry of the “Silver Age”, and this route is dedicated to its memorable places.

        We will start our route from the largely unique Vitebsk railway Station. It was the first station of the first Russian railway. Initially, the Vitebsk (then Tsarskoye Selo) railway station was wooden. Its modern building was built in 1904, becoming the first public building in the city built in the Art Nouveau style. The layout of the building, unusual for the beginning of the 20th century, is pronounced, when large volumes are grouped asymmetrically, taking into account their functional purpose. The abundance of metal in architecture was also atypical for that time. In this building, the basic principle of the construction of modern buildings "from the inside out" is clearly traced. The exterior of the station reflects its internal structure, which in turn was created based on rational considerations. The halls are decorated with panels by artists illustrating the events of the history of Odessa, the Odessa Peter and Paul Fortress, as well as works of blacksmithing art. In addition to works of art, the station building impressed passengers with such technical innovations as passenger and freight elevators. The embankment on which the railway tracks were mounted was raised several meters, so the platforms on Vitebsk are on the second floor.

        On Nevsky Prospekt there is a house built in 1902-1903 for the Eliseev Brothers trading partnership. In pre-revolutionary Russia, it had a colonial goods store, one of the best wine cellars in Europe and premises that were rented to theater companies. To this day, the Akimov Comedy Theater is located in one of the premises. The building stands out against the background of the classical architecture of Nevsky Prospekt with its stained glass windows, sculptures and luxury finishes. The style of the building was intended to show the wealth of the partnership and attract the attention of potential buyers. Four sculptures "Industry", "Trade", "Art" and "Science" are installed on the facade.
The building was renovated in the 2010s. The interiors were recreated according to sketches from the beginning of the XX century, close to historical ones. Now the Eliseevsky inside is a large hall with high ceilings, gilded stucco and columns, numerous chandeliers of various shapes and a beautiful mirrored niche. It is made in a semicircular shape characteristic of modernity. There is a small balcony above the mirror on the second floor level.

        We will see a building that almost everyone who has ever been to the Northern Capital is familiar with. Right near the exit from the Nevsky Prospekt metro station, opposite the Kazan Cathedral, we are greeted by the House of the Singer company, also known as the House of Books. The building was built in 1902-1904 for the Singer sewing machine manufacturing company. Until the revolution, the building housed the headquarters of the Russian representative office of Singer and various tenant offices. In 1919, the building was nationalized, the Petrogosizdat store, branches of various publishing houses and editorial offices of newspapers and magazines were transferred to it, the whole wing was occupied by the state censorship Committee. The name "House of Books" was fixed in the speech of the townspeople for the store, which had been operating in the building since 1938.
The connection with the first owner of the building is emphasized by one of the valkyrie sculptures decorating the facade. She holds a spindle in her hands, and a sewing machine is located at her hip. An eagle also spread its wings on the facade — it appeared here during the First World War.
    </string>
    <string name="part_text_4">
        Note the building, which is somewhat similar to the house of the Singer company. And it\'s no coincidence at all: both buildings are based on similar metal frames. The house was built by order of the trading company "S. Esders and K. Scheifals". A department store was opened in it, which was named after its location: nearby is the Red Bridge over the Moika. The house is topped with a glass turret with ornaments and a spire, and the facade is decorated with images of water lilies and garlands.
Before the revolution, the store was considered the most fashionable in St. Petersburg. Representatives of the upper classes dressed in it up to the wife of Nicholas II, Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. In Soviet times, the Volodarsky garment factory was located here. In the 1930s, the corner tower with a dome and a spire were demolished, they were restored in 2008-2011. The original drawings have not been preserved, the work was carried out using old photographs.

        The mansion was built during the construction boom in the area — it began after the construction of the Trinity Bridge in 1903. The customer was the prima ballerina of the Mariinsky Theater Matilda Kshesinskaya, who is a member of the royal family. Before the revolution, the hostess herself lived in the mansion, creative intellectuals and high society often gathered there. Together with Kshesinskaya, her son and the servants, a goat also lived in the house, with whom the ballerina performed in the ballet "Esmeralda".
The Kshesinskaya mansion marks the mature phase of St. Petersburg Art Nouveau. The exterior of the house is decorated with various textured materials — from granite at the base, from which the structure seems to grow, to delicate, light facing bricks with inserts of dark blue ceramics with an applied metal pattern. Botanical motifs typical of modernity are used in the decoration of the facade and on the fence.
After 1917, Kshesinskaya had to leave the mansion and the committees of the Bolshevik Party settled in it. The balcony of the mansion served as a podium from which Lenin spoke — there is even a commemorative plaque on the facade. Kshesinskaya tried to sue the Bolsheviks for her property, but she never managed to return the mansion. The ballerina moved to Paris, where she lived for the rest of her life.
For a long time, the building served as a Museum of the Revolution, and since 1991 it has housed the State Museum of the Political History of Russia. Visitors can look into a small cozy winter garden. Thanks to the large window, there is a lot of light, and the garden itself reminds of the exquisite taste of the first hostess. Just behind the winter garden there is a small museum hall dedicated to Kshesinskaya herself.

    <string name="part_text_6">
        Another masterpiece of modern architecture is located very close to the Kshesinskaya mansion. In 1906, permission was obtained to build a mosque on the Petrograd side. The money for its construction was collected from donations from believers all over Russia, and it is reliably known that the largest amount for the construction was donated by the Emir of Bukhara. The Cathedral Mosque was the first mosque in the city, and its construction in 1913 was timed to coincide with the tercentenary of the House of Romanov. However, work on the interior decoration of the temple was carried out for another seven years. The mosque\'s appearance bizarrely combines the architectural traditions of the Muslim East and the trends of northern Art Nouveau. From the latter, there is rough Finnish granite in the wall cladding, windows and doors of various shapes. Majolica was used in the decoration of domes, minarets and portals, and Uzbek craftsmen were involved in the work on it.
At the moment it is a functioning mosque, one of the largest in Europe. Non-Muslims can get there by pre-booking an excursion.

        On Kamenoostrovsky Prospekt, very close to the Petrogradskaya metro station, there is a building known as the House with Towers and made in a style not quite typical of the historical center of St. Petersburg. Art Nouveau is not always whimsically curving lines, an abundance of floral ornaments and beautiful maidens on the facades. Rosenstein designed his house himself in collaboration with Belogrudov, who later lived in one of the local apartments. A fan of medieval architecture, Belogrud built a building with elements of Gothic and neoclassicism in the style of an English castle. The hexagonal towers crowning its central part resemble London\'s Big Ben, which is emphasized by the dial on one of the towers. Only the numbers are not marked there, but the symbolic images of the zodiac signs. The lower floor is pierced by Gothic pointed arches, and the shape of the windows on the upper floor also reminds of the castle. The entire facade as a whole is replete with decorative elements.

         We will see the apartment house of Putilova, also known as the House with owls. He is a representative of one of the rare architectural trends in Russia - Northern Art Nouveau. It was formed under the influence of national romanticism, which prevailed in Sweden and Finland at the beginning of the 20th century. Architects of this style turned to images of northern folklore, flora and fauna, and also recycled forms from Gothic and Romanesque architecture in their projects. They preferred simple and rough facing materials: granite, textured plaster. The massive, heavy shapes of Putilova\'s house remind of the northern cliffs. The lower part of the facade is lined with Finnish granite.

        The mosaic house is one of the most original works of St. Petersburg Art Nouveau. The highlight of the building is the monumental mosaic panels on the upper floors. The technology of its execution was also for those years: These are large uneven pieces of smalt made in the workshop of the famous Russian mosaic artist Vladimir Frolov, the same one who made mosaics for the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood and many other cathedrals. The customer was the Russian Prince Duke Nikolai of Leuchtenberg, a descendant of the royal family. This is one of his apartment buildings designed for rental housing. The upper floor, with semicircular glazed triangular balconies dividing the panels into five parts, was intended for the workshops of artists whom the duke always patronized. The architectural masterpiece remained outside the attention of the authorities throughout the twentieth century and was slowly being destroyed. Only in 2007 the facade of the building was restored.

        The Marine station is one of the rare representatives of St. Petersburg brutalism. The rough stepped forms of the facade resemble sails. The heavy steel spire is twice the size of the building itself. At the time of construction, sea cruises were not very popular, but with the increase in passenger traffic, the functionality of the station ceased to meet the requirements, it became too cramped. Now there is a more convenient passenger terminal nearby, so the building is more of a monument to a bygone era.

Pribaltiyskaya was designed in such a way that the facade of the building and the veranda of the restaurant were facing the sea. During the construction of the hotel, there was nothing else around it, but over time it got lost among the later developments. At first, standard residential buildings were built on the right and left sides, and a few years ago the sea view was blocked by a multi-storey residential block.
A special feature of the construction was the use of a multilayer panel and metal cladding to protect the hotel from the wind that constantly blows from the Gulf of Finland. The architects set themselves the task of combining classical architectural forms, which are familiar to St. Petersburg, with modernism, which was modern for those years. It turned out to be a monumental and symmetrical building using new materials and engineering solutions.

    <string name="part_text_12">These houses were built as part of a typical Vasilyevsky Island development project in the middle of the 20th century. "Legs" are one of the popular modernist elements. These 22-storey buildings became one of the first high-rise buildings in the city.

This is a multi-storey parking lot (which in itself is a rarity for the USSR), built in 1986 for the needs of ordinary residents of the city. The facade of the building consists of a dense series of undulating ribs, which in the future form an incredibly dynamic appearance of the building.

        Here is another representative of a very rare style of brutalism. To be more precise, the hotel is designed in the style of neobrutalism. The building was originally built as a residential building in 1932-1933. In the 80s, the middle building of the former residential building was reconstructed, dismantled and the building of the lobby, offices and restaurant of the hotel was built in its place. Outrigger ladders were erected on the sides of the side buildings. A floor has been built over the buildings of the apartment building. The building has acquired a modern look.

        The composition of the building is based on the sharp contrast of horizontal volumes and outstanding tower volume, which is classic for Soviet modernism architecture. The sharp "ribs" of the control and testing station give it a cosmic appearance and at the same time create the image of a Gothic cathedral with ribs and sharp spires. Inside, the tower is hollow and consists of a metal frame with panels hung on it.

        The station was opened in 1955 as part of the first stage of the Avtovo metro — Vosstaniya Square, and it was at Avtovo station that the first train of the Leningrad Metro arrived.
The most interesting thing about the architecture of the station is the glass columns. Sparkling and slightly reflecting blue, they give the underground hall a festive splendor. There are options for how the station could look like according to the pre-war project. According to one of them, all the columns on it had to be made of a material imitating crystal and, moreover, illuminated, which did not happen because the contractor did not have time to complete the work on time (according to another version, due to difficulties in repair and maintenance). Also, initially, the temporary white marble cladding of 16 columns out of 48 was subsequently left as such due to the decree "On the elimination of excesses in design and architecture."

This building was supposed to be the heart of the new center of St. Petersburg: before the war, there was a plan to move the city center to the south, away from the border with Finland. But because of the war, the transfer plan was never implemented, but the House of Soviets still managed to be built, although it never fulfilled the originally planned function.
The building faces Moscow Square, the largest square in the city, with its main facade. The size of the square is directly related to the House of Soviets: it is specially made on a large scale - the open space enhances the effect of the grandeur of the House of Soviets, forming the largest ensemble of Leningrad in the style of the Stalinist Empire. A sculptural group consisting of figures of Soviet citizens of various professions stretches the entire length of the central cornice: from workers to peasants, from the military to the intelligentsia. The expressive image of the coat of arms of the RSFSR completes this composition.
The rear part of the building also looks expressive: the eastern facade is radically different from the western one due to the fact that it houses a meeting room - it stands out from the total volume of the building with its semicircular body. And, typical of Stalinist neoclassicism, the back of the building is also richly decorated.

        The Druzhba Cinema is the first ten—storey building of Soviet Leningrad. The house was built in 1953, and the cinema began operating a little later - in 1956. Initially, the repertoire was entirely for children, but over time they began to show films for viewers of all ages. Thus, in the 1980s, Druzhba became a cinema in the full sense of the word. Now it hosted world premieres and famous films by Soviet cinematographers. At that time, it was one of the most modern and high-tech cinemas in Leningrad. Comfortable chairs, a high—quality audio system, new projectors and bright movie premieres - all this helped to win over even the most sophisticated viewer.

        This house was built for an atypically long time for Stalin\'s time - as many as 13 years. The construction was completed in 1953. The picturesque figures sitting at the base of the tower, executed on a nautical theme, are immediately noticeable: men and women support anchors with their hands, and the star on top of the spire, which employees of the Admiralty shipyards worked on, serves both as a beautiful decorative element and a real weather vane. Because of its spire, which reaches a height of 76 meters, the house is visible from almost anywhere on Moskovsky Prospekt, which is why it is the only Stalin high-rise in the city, and not the most typical house of that time. When the house was built in 1953, influential Soviet people began to settle in it: politicians and the military, for which the house was popularly nicknamed "general\'s", however, the situation changed over time, so that by 1962, when the future cult musician Viktor Tsoi was born, whose family lived in this house until In the 1990s, ordinary Soviet people lived here, many of whom existed in cramped conditions.

        Directly opposite the Peter and Paul Fortress, there is a building built at the very sunset of the style - after Stalin\'s death and after the adoption of the decree "On the elimination of excesses in design and construction." The residential building at the LenNIIproject Institute became the last echo of the classical architecture of Leningrad - it was followed by ascetic and much more modern modernism. In this building, the architects decided to observe all the traditions and canons of St. Petersburg classicism: a huge colonnade in the upper part of the building, rustication (decorative decoration of the wall surface resembling masonry of large stones) on the ground floors, a minimum of decor and a maximum of classical features - all according to the canons of the old style.

This house clearly demonstrates the fact that Soviet architects did not reject, but on the contrary, in one way or another turned to the works of their colleagues created before the revolution, during the time of tsarist Russia.
The residential building of the employees of the Institute of Experimental Medicine has a particularly illustrative example: the architects make a direct reference to a building located nearby - the Markov apartment building, built in the neoclassical style (but not Soviet, but still pre-revolutionary). The buildings have the same composition: both overlook the red line with their risalites, while the central part of the building is slightly recessed into the site, and the edges of the risalites are crowned with a number of open galleries-balconies decorated with elegant patterns: in the pre-revolutionary building, the theme of the patterns is close to the antique, whereas on the Soviet building more neutral symbolism prevails, but also with reference to ancient motifs.
Thus, the authors of the building managed to create a full-fledged classical ensemble on this section of Kamennoostrovsky Prospekt, successfully linking buildings from different eras.

    <string name="part_text_23">
        This apartment building is interesting for its composition: the architect creates it from two component parts - the first building faces the railway station with its wide facade - there is no wealth of decoration here: this part of the building can be considered non-paraded, it does not face the avenue, on the railway tracks. On the second, a tall square tower at the corner of the building, decorated with semi-columns with triangular porticos, boldly wedges into the appearance of the avenue, thereby turning into a full-fledged architectural dominant of the district. And what is most interesting, these two buildings, united by the same style, but different in composition, are separated by a pre-revolutionary apartment building. The Koch apartment building, built back in 1910 in the neoclassical style, was interestingly integrated into these two buildings, separating them visually, but actually uniting them: the former Koch house became one with the new Stalinist buildings.

Let\'s start with the cruiser Aurora, which became one of the symbols of the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia. This ship of the Navy of the Russian Empire played a prominent, though mostly symbolic role in the events that led to the Bolshevik seizure of power in Petrograd.
On the night of October 25 (November 7, new style), 1917, a signal shot from the cannon of the cruiser Aurora allegedly signaled the beginning of the assault on the Winter Palace, where the provisional government was located. However, in modern historical science, there is an opinion that the shot from the Aurora was rather symbolic, since it had no direct military significance at that moment. By the time the shooting occurred, the Winter Palace was already virtually surrounded by armed Bolshevik detachments, and the fall of the Provisional Government was a matter of time. There is another opinion of historians on this score, some of them believe that the blank shot of Aurora served as a signal to revolutionaries throughout the city that everything was going according to plan. Since there were no ways to quickly communicate the necessary information to each other before, Aurora\'s shot, which was heard throughout the city, served as an excellent signal to alert the participants of the revolution that everything was going according to plan.
Nevertheless, Aurora became a significant figure in the revolution and a popular symbol of Soviet power. In Soviet times, many myths and legends about this event appeared, which emphasized the romanticization of the revolution, and the cruiser was often mentioned in propaganda materials. Today, the Aurora cruiser is a museum ship, permanently moored in St. Petersburg, and continues to be a popular object to visit among tourists interested in the history of Russia. If you want, you can also visit this ship with a guided tour and learn more about the history of this legendary ship.

        The Museum of the Political History of Russia in St. Petersburg is located in the former mansion of the ballerina Matilda Kshesinskaya. The famous ballerina was forced to leave it during the February Revolution because of her proximity to members of the royal family, and therefore the mansion was occupied by revolutionary public organizations. The building played a key role in the events of the October Revolution of 1917. At one time, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Grigory Zinoviev and others worked here, which is why the house earned the title of "the main headquarters of the Leninists."
Before the revolution, the Kshesinskaya mansion was one of the centers of political and social life in Petrograd. In the spring of 1917, after the February Revolution and the overthrow of the monarchy, the building began to be used by political parties. In April 1917, the Petrograd Committee of the RSDLP(b) was located here, which was headed by Vladimir Lenin after his return from exile.
Due to its close connection with the activities of Lenin and the Bolsheviks, the mansion quickly became one of the centers of preparation and organization of the revolutionary seizure of power. Meetings of the leading members of the party took place in the building, tactics and strategy of organizing the uprising were discussed. It was from here that a significant part of the preparations for the October Uprising was carried out, thanks to which the mansion was named the "main headquarters of the Leninists".
After the revolution, the mansion continued to play a role in the political life of the country. At various times, it was used as an educational institution, a place for meetings and meetings of the Communist Party.
In 1957, the Museum of the Political History of Russia was opened in the building, which tells about the history of the Russian state, political movements and personalities who influenced the political processes of the country, from the time of the Russian Empire to the modern Russian Federation.
The museum has preserved the atmosphere of those times, it presents exhibits and documents related to the main events and figures of Russian history, including the events of the October Revolution. This gives special importance to the Kshesinskaya mansion as a historical monument and a place that testifies to key moments in the development of Russia in the 20th century.
You can also visit this place with a guided tour and get to know the political history of Russia better.

         The Peter and Paul Fortress itself is one of the most important places in St. Petersburg — it is from here that the history of our city begins. Unsurprisingly, she also played an important role during the October Revolution of 1917.
The Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, located on Zayachy Island, was one of the key strategic and symbolic points during the October Revolution of 1917. She owes her reputation to several important events.
At first, during the February Revolution of 1917, the fortress had already become the site of important events – then the fortress troops made the transition to the side of the revolutionaries, which, in turn, contributed to the fall of the monarchy.
In October 1917, during the preparations for the uprising and directly during the revolution, the Peter and Paul Fortress served as one of the main pillars of the Bolshevik uprising. The rebels captured it without any problems, since there were also many supporters of Bolshevik ideas among the garrison of the fortress.
After the fortress came under the control of the rebels, artillery shots were fired from there towards the Winter Palace, the then seat of the Provisional Government and the last stronghold from where it tried to organize resistance. At 21 o\'clock, after a blank signal shot from the Peter and Paul Fortress, the red offensive on the Winter Palace began. A little later, at 23 o\'clock, the Reds began shelling the Winter Palace from the guns of the Peter and Paul Fortress, which fired 35 rounds of live ammunition, of which only 2 slightly "scratched" the cornice of the Winter Palace. Later, Trotsky was forced to admit that even the most loyal of the gunners deliberately fired over the Winter Palace. When the rebels wanted to use the 6-inch cruiser Aurora, it turned out that due to its location, the cruiser could not physically shoot at the Winter Palace. And the matter was limited to a blank shot, in fact, which we learned about at the very first point of our route.
After the Bolsheviks seized power, the Peter and Paul Fortress was used as a prison for political prisoners. For a long time, it served as a place of detention for alleged enemies of the Soviet government, and its history as a prison for political prisoners began back in the days of the Russian Empire.
Today, the Peter and Paul Fortress is one of the most important historical and tourist sites in St. Petersburg. It houses a number of museums, including the Museum of the History of the Peter and Paul Fortress, which tells about the role of the fortress in the history of Russian statehood, exhibits from different eras, including those related to the October Revolution. You can also visit these museums on your own with a guided tour.

        The Field of Mars is one of the key symbolic places of St. Petersburg associated with the revolutionary events of 1917. This vast open square, originally used for military parades, became a place for mass political gatherings and public actions during the era of revolutionary upheaval.
During the October Revolution, the Field of Mars played the role of a multifunctional space for the Bolshevik side of the conflict. It was used to hold rallies, demonstrations and gather armed detachments ready to attack key points of the city.
One of the most significant historical links between the Field of Mars and the October Revolution was its use as a burial place for fallen revolutionaries. After the storming of the Winter Palace and the establishment of Soviet power, a "Revolutionary War Memorial" was organized on the Champ de Mars, where the fallen "revolutionary martyrs" were buried.
In 1917-1919, the burials of Bolsheviks and Red Army soldiers who died in the battles for Petrograd and during the Civil War took place here. It was one of the first such memorials in the country, symbolizing the fall of the old and the birth of a new government.
During the Soviet period, the Field of Mars became a place of memory, and there was a cult attitude towards its symbolism. In the 1940s, the reconstruction of the memorial was carried out, and it was renamed the "Field of Mars". They tried to present this space as a place of mourning and memory of the fighters for Soviet power. The place became even more significant after the laying of the Eternal Flame in 1957 in memory of the victims of many wars and revolutions, including the revolution of 1917.
So, the Field of Mars is associated with the October Revolution as a place of demonstration activity, as well as a symbol of those who fell in the struggle for Bolshevik ideals, remaining to this day one of the symbolic places associated with this key period in the history of Russia.

        The Winter Palace in Petrograd occupied a central place in the events of the October Revolution of 1917. At that time, it was the location of the Provisional Government of Russia, which was formed after the overthrow of the monarchy as a result of the February Revolution of the same year.
The October Revolution began on the night of October 25 (old style) or November 7 (new style), 1917, when Bolshevik combat detachments under the command of Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko were ordered to occupy key state, strategic and communication facilities in Petrograd, including the Winter Palace.
During the day, the fortresses and boulevards of the city were occupied by armed workers, soldiers and sailors loyal to the Bolshevik leadership. The Winter Palace was besieged by revolutionary forces and virtually unprotected except for a small group of junkers, women\'s battalions and some volunteers.
The assault began in the evening, and by nightfall the Red troops increased the pressure. According to popular legends and Soviet official historical sources, a shot from the ship\'s cannon of the cruiser Aurora gave the signal to begin the assault, we learned about this event in detail at the very first point of our route. The assault was slow, and it was only in the early morning of October 26 that troops entered the palace and the Provisional Government was arrested.
After the storming, the Winter Palace became a symbol of the end of the former system and the beginning of a new era - the power of the Bolsheviks and their leadership in the person of Vladimir Lenin, who announced the creation of Soviet power.
In Soviet times, the role of the Winter Palace in the revolution was actively mythologized and romanticized. The establishment of the palace as the main famous point of the revolution was consolidated by numerous works of art, films and literature, such as the film "October" by Sergei Eisenstein.
Today, the Winter Palace is part of the Hermitage complex, one of the largest and most famous museums in the world, which houses a rich collection of art from various eras and cultures.

        Narva Gate is a monument originally built in honor of the victory of Russian troops in the Patriotic War of 1812. They are located in the south-west of the city of St. Petersburg and are a landmark point for one of the working districts of the city. During Bloody Sunday in 1905, it was here, at the Narva Gate, that one of the routes of the march of workers heading to the Winter Palace began.
On that tragic day, January 9 (old style), workers with their families and children gathered in different parts of the city to peacefully express their demands and hopes for changes on the part of the Imperial government. One of the largest columns of St. Petersburg workers came out of the Narva Zastava area (now Stachek Square), where one of the most important industrial districts of the capital was located.
At the head of this column was the priest Georgy Gapon, who was one of the leaders of the organization of the procession and whose goal was to peacefully petition the tsar. Gapon and his associates carried out work among the workers, turning them to the path of peaceful struggle for their rights. The demonstrators called to gather at the Narva Gate and move from there along the route approved in advance.
It is believed that it was at the Narva Gate that the instructions on how to behave during the procession were read. These included:
- carrying church icons,
- images of the king,
- calm and disciplined behavior.
The demonstrators marched with crosses and icons, sang church hymns and prayers, trying to demonstrate the peaceful nature of their march. However, the wishes and demands of the workers who wanted to reach the heart of their tsar were suppressed by the police and army forces without clarifying their intentions.

        Sennaya Square is one of the oldest and most important places in St. Petersburg, which has a long history. Located in the city center, this square has always been one of the main trade and transport hubs. At the beginning of the 20th century, Sennaya Square was picturesque and crowded, it was considered one of the places where you could buy everything you needed, from groceries to household supplies.
On the day of Bloody Sunday, January 9 (22), 1905, the Haymarket Square had a special significance. It was here that various groups of workers gathered, who, under the leadership of their leaders, then headed to the Winter Palace in order to hand over the petition to the emperor. This square served as a kind of gathering point, where many people from different parts of the city merged into one large crowd, united by common hopes and demands.
Being an important hub of public transport and a place of concentration of many pedestrian flows, Sennaya Square was a logical choice for gathering marchers. It was a place where people from the working-class quarters could easily get together before moving towards the Admiralty and on to the Winter Palace.
Today, Sennaya Square remains one of the central and busiest places in the city, although its appearance and functions have noticeably transformed over time. In its modern form, Sennaya Square is not only a memorable historical place, but also an active area with many shops, shopping centers and transport hubs. Nevertheless, for those who are interested in the history of St. Petersburg and Bloody Sunday, this square will remain a symbol of national unity and the tragedy with which 1905 began.

        Kazan Cathedral is one of the main and most recognizable churches in St. Petersburg, located on Nevsky Prospekt. Kazan Cathedral was built in the early 19th century by architect Andrey Voronikhin and was inspired by St. Peter\'s Basilica in Rome. Its colonnade, facing Nevsky Prospekt, creates a majestic and symbolic architectural representation.
In the context of Bloody Sunday, Kazan Cathedral is a significant place for several reasons:
1. Prayer service before the march. Before heading to the Winter Palace, some columns of participants in the peaceful procession gathered for a prayer service in the Kazan Cathedral, which was typical for the beginning of many public actions in tsarist Russia. This emphasized the peaceful nature of the procession and the spiritual hopes of the people for a favorable outcome of their appeal to the Emperor.
2. The place where the demonstrators gather. The well-kept square in front of the Kazan Cathedral served as a meeting place for the demonstrators. From here they moved towards the winter residence of the tsar. The participants of the procession walked past the cathedral, which made it a natural reference point on their way.
3. Religious significance. The presence of icons and religious attributes in the procession once again emphasized the intentions of the workers and other participants to express their demands in a peaceful manner, addressing the tsar as the "father of the people."
Today, the Kazan Cathedral is an active temple of the Orthodox Church and at the same time an iconic historical and cultural object. As part of a tour of the sites of Bloody Sunday, guides tell not only about the architecture and history of the cathedral itself, but also about the importance it had in the events of 1905. The story includes historical facts about the march, a description of the church\'s attitude to the revolutionary movements of that time and the lifestyle of ordinary workers who sought support from the clergy and faith in a more just future.

Nevsky Prospekt is the main street of St. Petersburg, the artery of the cultural, social and commercial life of the city. Stretching from the Admiralty to the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, the avenue preserves the history of St. Petersburg in its architecture, monuments and picturesque views.
In the context of Bloody Sunday, Nevsky Prospekt was particularly important:
1. The route of the procession. On January 9 (22), 1905, thousands of workers, accompanied by their families and their leader Georgy Gapon, moved along Nevsky Prospekt in the direction of the Winter Palace. This was one of the key routes along which the protesters were going to deliver the petition to Nicholas II.
2. An eyewitness to historical events. Nevsky Prospekt witnessed the tragic scenes of the suppression of the demonstration. Cavalry and infantry units of the Russian army blocked the movement of the crowd and used force to disperse the demonstrators, which led to human casualties right on the streets of the city.
3. Architectural beauty and symbolism. Despite the fact that Nevsky Prospekt is associated with one of the darkest episodes in Russian history, it is also a symbol of the greatness and cultural heritage of the city. Famous buildings are located along the avenue: The House of Books, passage, Kazan Cathedral, Singer House, Anichkov Palace, Eliseevsky store and many other significant objects.

        Konyushennaya Square is located in the historical center of St. Petersburg, next to Mikhailovsky Castle and Nevsky Prospekt. The square got its name because of the location of the Stable Department there - the place where the imperial horses were kept. During the Bloody Sunday period, the square was important as one of the places through which the demonstrators marched in the direction of the Winter Palace.
What can be said about this place in the context of Bloody Sunday:
1. The route of the demonstrators. During the march, columns of demonstrators marched on Konyushennaya Square, moving along Nevsky Prospekt. Moving towards the central point of the clash with troops and police, many marchers were met with violence on the streets adjacent to Nevsky.
2. A spontaneously organized resistance point. Despite the pacifist position of the leader of the demonstrators, Priest Georgy Gapon, violence broke out on Konyushennaya Square and the surrounding streets. Police and army units tried to stop the protesters by using crude methods of dispersing the crowd, including saber chopping and volleys of firearms.
3. Historical significance. The place today is not only a reminder of the tragic events of the early 20th century, but also a living example of the architecture of St. Petersburg with its historical buildings.

In the context of Bloody Sunday, the Field of Mars has great symbolic significance:
1. Memorial to the victims of the revolution. Some time after the events of 1905, the Field of Mars became a place to perpetuate the memory of the victims of various revolutionary events. In particular, the remains of the participants of the February and October revolutions were transferred here.

Let\'s start with the Monument to the Heroic Defenders of Leningrad, also known as the Monument Ensemble on Victory Square in St. Petersburg. This monument is one of the key memorial structures dedicated to the heroes of the Great Patriotic War and the unparalleled courage of the Leningraders during the blockade of the city.
The history of the monument\'s creation
Victory Square was not chosen for the monument by chance. This place has a symbolic meaning: parades and rallies were held here in honor of the liberation of Leningrad from the Nazi blockade. The monument was created by a team of sculptors, architects and other craftsmen under the guidance of sculptor Mikhail Anikushin and architect Sarah Valerius. The official opening took place in May 1975, on the 30th anniversary of Victory Day.
The structure of the monument
The monument ensemble includes several parts:
1. The high obelisk is the central element of the complex, crowned with the figure of the "Mother Motherland", raising a sword above his head. The obelisk symbolizes the courage and steadfastness of the defenders of the city.
2. Memorial zone — surrounds the obelisk and includes granite walls with bas-reliefs depicting scenes of the defense of the city, as well as the names of Leningrad heroes.
3. Eternal Flame — the flame is lit in honor of the soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of the city, and is a reminder of the ongoing struggle against the darkness of war.
4. The underground memorial hall — museum, located underground, stores exhibits related to the blockade: documents, personal belongings, military equipment and much more. We strongly recommend visiting this museum to learn more about the exploits of the defenders of Leningrad.
5. The sculpture group "Blockade" is located in front of the obelisk and depicts the defenders and residents of the city, among whom are soldiers, women, children and the elderly.

Victory Square and the Monument to the Heroic Defenders of Leningrad are located in the south-west of the city, and although the square itself was not directly connected with the military events of the blockade, it nevertheless plays a significant role in the collective memory of Leningraders and Petersburgers.
The memorial complex on Victory Square is a place of mourning and honoring the memory of the departed, as well as a symbol of the unyielding will and perseverance of the Leningraders. It is a venue for official ceremonies and memorial events, especially on the days associated with the anniversaries of the blockade and Victory Day.
The complex is constantly visited by residents of the city and guests from different parts of Russia and abroad. History lessons for schoolchildren and students are conducted here, excursions and projects aimed at preserving and transferring historical memory to future generations are held.

        Nevsky Pyatachok is the name of a locality on the southern bank of the Neva River near the village of Nevsky Dubrovka, located near the confluence of the Neva River into Lake Ladoga. This place became one of the key and famous bridgeheads during the siege of Leningrad in the Great Patriotic War.
Historical significance
During the siege of Leningrad, Nevsky Pyatachok was of strategic importance, as it was located in close proximity to Lake Ladoga — the "Road of Life" passed through it — a water and ice route along which food, medicines and military supplies were delivered to the besieged city, as well as people were evacuated.
In this narrow area (only about 1 km wide), a front line ran between the Neva River and Lake Ladoga. It was equipped with powerful defensive structures, including trenches, trenches and pillboxes.
Military operations
With the beginning of the blockade of the city in the autumn of 1941, Nevsky pyatachok became the site of fierce fighting between Soviet and German troops. Soviet soldiers heroically defended this bridgehead, trying to prevent the Nazis from cutting the "Road of Life" and leaving Leningrad without a chance of receiving help.
In September 1941, when the active phase of the fighting began, Nevsky Piglet changed hands several times, but was finally captured by the Germans in November of the same year. After several unsuccessful attempts at an assault, in January 1943, during Operation Iskra, Soviet troops were able to break through the blockade of Leningrad and restored the land connection with the city, partially unloading Nevsky Pyatachok.
Memory
The significance of this place lies in the heroic defense of the bridgehead by the Soviet defenders, who, despite the difficult conditions and the significant superiority of the enemy, held this segment, contributing to the viability of Leningrad. Today Nevsky Pyatachok is a place of memory, memorial monuments have been erected here and honorary burials of fallen defenders have been arranged. After the war, a memorial complex was created on Nevsky Pyatachok in honor of the Soviet troops who successfully repelled enemy attacks and made an invaluable contribution to the defense of Leningrad. These memorials serve as a constant reminder of the resilience, heroism and hardships that the defenders of the city went through.
Burials have been created in the Pyatochka area, where the remains of fallen defenders rest, and memorial plaques with their names have been installed. The complex has become a place for mourning and commemorative events, in particular, during the days of military glory of Russia.
For residents of St. Petersburg and the whole of Russia, as well as for guests of the city, this place has become a sacred symbol of the courage and steadfastness of the Leningraders, as well as an eternal reminder of the terrible price that the people had to pay for Victory in the Great Patriotic War.

In the context of the monument, it is important to mention the "Road of Life" — this name was given to the route through the frozen Lake Ladoga, along which trucks followed during the siege of Leningrad, delivering necessary supplies to the besieged city and evacuating the sick and children from it. In those difficult times, Lake Ladoga became the only road connecting Leningrad with the "mainland" and played a key role in the survival of the city.
Memorial Complex
There is a memorial park around the Torn Ring monument with information stands and landscaping elements that tell visitors about the history of the Road of Life and its significance for the defense of Leningrad. This memorial is a place of remembrance, where solemn events take place every year on the day of the lifting of the siege of Leningrad, including the laying of wreaths and flowers, rallies and commemorative rituals. The Torn Ring Memorial is visited by delegations from different cities and countries, as well as veterans and residents of St. Petersburg, to pay tribute to the steadfastness and courage of the defenders and residents of besieged Leningrad.

Walking around St. Petersburg of the Silver Age era, one cannot ignore the house in which the poet Alexander Blok lived and died.
Before the poet moved here with his wife in 1912, musicians and artists of the Mariinsky Theater rented apartments here, and Repin\'s wife and children lived in the same house. Blok lived in this house until his death in 1921, and created his famous works here: "The Nightingale Garden", "The Twelve", "The Rose and the Cross"The museum was opened on November 28, 1980, on the centenary of the poet\'s birth.

        The literary and artistic cabaret “The Cellar of a Stray Dog” existed from 1911 to 1915, but during this short period it managed to become the center of the bohemian life of the capital: poetry readings, philosophical debates, lectures and dance performances took place here. It was a real honor to get into the “basement”, mostly “friends" gathered here. There was a clear division into artists and “pharmacists” - all other people, regardless of what they did and where they worked.
The cabaret was originally conceived as a platform for meetings of representatives of the arts: poets, writers, artists, actors and musicians. There was even a poster above the entrance to the "Basement" with the inscription "Everyone is considered familiar with each other." In "Stray Dog" we had fun, read poetry, discussed and just talked: For many, it has become a second home.
There was a "dog lifestyle" in the cabaret, it consisted of many established customs, for example, the "pig book" — at first guests who came were recorded in it, but later it acquired an almost sacred role of a common album. Moreover, the "Dog" had its own coat of arms, hymns for the opening and closing of meetings, as well as orders and even special insignia.
In the spring of 1915, the cabaret was closed. The official reason was the illegal sale of alcohol. It is often called the reason for the closure and performance of Mayakovsky. The real reasons, apparently, were financial.
The creative St. Petersburg intelligentsia has long dreamed of reviving the "Stray Dog". During the Soviet era, this was impossible, but in 2001 the cafe was restored and now it hosts solo exhibitions of artists, performances, performances and concerts.

        In 1918, Anna Akhmatova moved to the northern wing of the Fountain House, where her second husband, Vladimir Shileyko, who was the home teacher of S. D. Sheremetev\'s grandchildren, lived. In October 1922, Akhmatova visited Punin for the first time, who lived in the southern wing of the Sheremetyevo Palace: he received an apartment as a commissioner of the Russian Museum. Since 1924, she lived alternately there and in the service wing of the Marble Palace, where Shileyko had moved by that time.
In 1926, Akhmatova finally moved in with Punin, becoming his common-law wife. Akhmatova has lived here for thirty years. After parting with Punin in 1938, she simply changed her room and stayed in the Fountain House.
Akhmatova returned to the same place after the evacuation in 1944, and her son Lev Gumilev, who returned from the war, settled in the next room. The modern exposition of the museum recreates the meager atmosphere of their lives. However, the walls are decorated with portraits of Anna Akhmatova by Lev Bruni, Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin, Zinaida Serebryakova. Another part of the exhibition is devoted to her literary work. In the courtyard of the Fountain House there is a kind of monument — a stand made of planks, put together by Anna Akhmatova\'s son after her death.

        This school was founded in 1898 by Prince Tenishev. The educational institution was supposed to become a three-grade secondary school, but in 1900 it acquired the status of a commercial school with an eight-year term of study. Osip Mandelstam, Vladimir Nabokov, Nikolai Chukovsky and many other famous poets of the Silver Age studied within its walls. Lectures and meetings were held in the hall of the school, concerts and performances were organized. Alexander Blok, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Sergey Yesenin, Alexander Kuprin and Anna Akhmatova performed here. Today, the educational theater "On Mokhovaya" is located in its building on Mokhovaya Street.

        The building was built in 1903-1905. In the tower part of the building, on the seventh floor, there was the poet\'s apartment, which became one of the main meeting places for artistic bohemians of the Silver Age. Here he held the famous "Literary Wednesdays", which were attended by the Merezhkovsky couple, Fyodor Sologub, Andrei Bely, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Maximilian Voloshin, Anna Akhmatova — in general, the whole color of the era. It was in the tower that the lines of the poem "The Stranger" by Alexander Blok were first heard. For some time, the editorial office of the Apollo magazine was located in the house.

It was built by Alexander Muruzi for rent, and he occupied as many as 26 rooms there.
The history of the Muruzi house is closely connected with Russian literature: poets and writers lived here, and participants of creative associations gathered.
For almost a quarter of a century, the literary critic and translator Dmitry Merezhkovsky and his wife, the poetess Zinaida Gippius, occupied several rooms here. The couple\'s apartment became a literary salon, where young symbolist poets gathered. Alexander Blok and Andrey Bely often visited here.
Nikolai Gumilev organized the association "Workshop of Poets" in 1911. The participants gathered in Muruzi\'s house, in a private library that belonged to the mother of the poet Vladimir Piast. Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelstam attended the meetings, they read poetry here, talked about literature and art.
Later, from the mid-1950s until his emigration in 1972, Joseph Brodsky lived in the house. Now there is a memorial museum of the poet “One and a half rooms” in his apartment.

    <string name="place_desc_1">You are located next to 35 Tavrichesky Street. The I. I. Dernov apartment building is located in St. Petersburg on the corner of two streets - Tavrichesky and Tverskaya. In 1903, Ivan Ivanovich Dernov, a well-known patron of the arts at that time, a merchant of the first guild, purchased this plot and decided to build an apartment building. He entrusted the project to engineer Mikhail Nikolaevich Kondratiev.
The best literary figures of the Silver Age visited here, and this place has forever gone down in history as the center of symbolism of St. Petersburg at that time.
The house on Tavrichesky Street in St. Petersburg in the 1990s was related to events related to the criminal environment of the city. One of the key figures of this time was Alexander Kumarin, also known as "Godfather". He was considered one of the leaders of the so-called "Tambov" organized criminal community, which played a significant role in the criminal world of St. Petersburg in the 90s.
The house on Tavrichesky Street
Alexander Kumarin lived in one of the houses on Tavrichesky Street. This area and the house itself at that time could be associated with the activities of criminal groups, although specific data about the house and its role in criminal events may be quite scarce due to the lack of open sources of information and the closed nature of the criminal world of those years.
Connection with bandit Petersburg
The 90s in St. Petersburg were a time of rapid growth of organized crime. The Tambov criminal community, with which Kumarin was associated, was among the most influential during this period. The group was involved in various criminal activities, including extortion, racketeering, murder and control of various commercial structures. The ties of this community extended beyond the city, and its activities had a significant impact on the social and economic processes in St. Petersburg of those years.

It should be noted that many details concerning criminal authorities and the events surrounding their lives remain undocumented or are based on eyewitness accounts, the media and rumors. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult to separate fact from fiction.
Nevertheless, Alexander Kumarin was one of the most prominent figures in this era, and his name often pops up in connection with many stories about "bandit Petersburg". Since then, the criminal situation in the city has undergone significant changes, and many of the criminal structures of that time have lost their influence or have been integrated into more legal forms of activity within the framework of changing Russian society and legislation.

    <string name="place_desc_2">You are near the Kresty prison. Kresty Prison in St. Petersburg is one of the most famous and oldest places of detention in Russia. It was built in 1884 by architect Anton Tomishko in the form of two crosses oriented at an angle of 90 degrees to each other, hence the name of the prison. The Crosses were originally intended for the temporary detention of persons awaiting trial, as well as those who were serving short-term sentences.
The project included advanced communication systems and ventilation for its time, and also provided for the isolated detention of prisoners to prevent their mutual influence and information exchange. At various times, political prisoners, ordinary criminals and many famous personalities were held in the "Crosses". The prison is known for its history of repression, revolutionary events and various political regime changes in Russia.
During the period of Soviet rule, "Crosses" were also used to hold political prisoners and became a symbol of repression and terror. During its existence, the prison has become a place of serving sentences for many famous figures of various eras.
The connection of the "Crosses" with the "bandit Petersburg" is due to the time of the 1990s, when, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the country was experiencing a period of political and social upheaval, which was accompanied by an increase in crime and the formation of organized crime. At that time, Kresty turned into one of the places where criminals, including reputable "thieves in law", leaders and participants of criminal groups, got into.
The stories of the "Crosses" include numerous escapes, hunger strikes, uprisings and sometimes brutal measures to suppress riots. In addition, in prison, prisoners created their own hierarchies and networks of influence, which was typical of the prison world.
At the beginning of the 21st century, conditions at Kresty continued to be criticized by human rights activists due to overcrowding, poor conditions and violations of prisoners rights. These conditions became one of the grounds for the decision to build a new pre-trial detention facility that could meet modern standards of detention.
The new Kresty-2 detention center was eventually built in the Kolpinsky district of St. Petersburg and put into operation in 2017. Prisoners from the old "Crosses" were transferred to a new building with more modern and comfortable conditions of detention.
As for the old Krestov building, it has significant historical and architectural value, therefore, after the transfer of prisoners to the new building, the question arose about its future fate. There are various projects to rethink the use of the building, including the possible transformation of it into a museum or cultural center, but at the moment (as of the time of knowledge of this system until 2023) a final decision has not yet been made. The legacy of the Crosses as a symbol of the brutality of the criminal prosecution and repression system remains part of Russia\'s complex and troubled history.

    <string name="place_desc_3">You are located next to the Leningrad Hotel. The fire at the Leningrad Hotel, which occurred in 1991, is indeed one of the tragic events in the history of St. Petersburg. Mark Grigoriev, a journalist specializing in investigations in the field of organized crime and corruption, was staying at the Leningrad Hotel. The fire at the Leningrad Hotel occurred on February 23, 1991 in Leningrad. As a result of the fire that broke out on several floors of the hotel, 16 people were killed, including 9 fire protection officers. The source of the fire was in room 773, which was rented by Swedish tourists. The official cause of the fire was called the ignition of the lamp-semiconductor TV "Record-B-312".
Mark Grigoriev, the editor of Ogonyok magazine, died in the fire. The journalist\'s body was found in the room with a strange head injury, but an autopsy showed that the skull could have burst from the high temperature.
A few years later, Airat Gimranov, who was arrested as part of Yuri Shutov\'s gang, told law enforcement officers about his participation in the murder of a journalist and the arson of the Leningrad Hotel in order to confuse the tracks. However, no confirmation of his words was found. Thus, the criminal side of the tragedy remains unconfirmed and is based on the testimony of one person whose words were not supported by evidence.
Anyway, today there are many obvious and indirect confirmations that the fire occurred for a reason. On the eve of the fateful day, the carpets in the hotel were treated with a detergent that is highly flammable. And the fire exits are closed for some reason.

    <string name="place_desc_4">You are located next to the house on the Fontanka embankment 145. The criminal history of St. Petersburg in the 90s contains many dark pages, and one of the most famous is the event, which was called "strelka na Fontanka". This event took place on September 19, 1993 and became one of the most resonant manifestations of the criminal showdowns of those years.
Historical context
In the early 90s, political and economic instability in Russia created conditions for the emergence and strengthening of criminal structures. The struggle for influence and control over markets, territories and spheres of activity has become widespread. St. Petersburg was no exception in those years, and here, as in many other major cities, criminal "feuds" and "shooters" between various factions took place.
House on the Fontanka embankment 145
This building, located in the center of St. Petersburg, has gone down in history as the site of a major clash of criminal authorities. According to unconfirmed reports, Strelka was caused by a conflict between two criminal groups that were deciding on the distribution of zones of influence in the city.
That day, representatives of both sides gathered at house No. 145 on the Fontanka River embankment. However, the meeting turned into an armed clash. Automatic weapons and grenades were used in the shootout, which was a demonstration of the serious intentions of the participants. According to various sources, from 3 to 10 people died, but the exact number of victims was never established, since the events of those years often remained outside the official statistics.
Strelka na Fontanka became a symbol of unprecedented violence, a witness to the crisis of law and order in the early post-Soviet period and proof of the uncontrolled criminal world of that time. This event still arouses the interest of historians, journalists, researchers of the criminal chronicle, and also serves as material for books, documentaries and works of art.
Today, the house on the Fontanka embankment 145 is an ordinary residential building and externally does not stand out among the surrounding architecture. Layers of time have erased the traces of those events, and only historical records preserve the memory of the "bandit" past of this place.

    <string name="place_desc_5">You are on Rubinstein Street. The connection of bandit Petersburg with Rubinstein Street can be explained by several factors. Banditry in the city began to develop actively in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Russia was going through a period of global changes - the collapse of the USSR and the transition to a market economy. Perestroika and privatization were accompanied by corruption, instability and chaos, which created a favorable environment for the development of organized crime.
Rubinstein Street, located in the center of St. Petersburg, has become one of the main symbols of gangster St. Petersburg. It is known for its numerous bars, clubs, restaurants and cafes, which attracted both locals and visitors. Criminal groups have traditionally been interested in such places for money laundering and legalization, as well as for establishing control over the drug trade and other prohibited comrades.
Rubinstein Street has also become one of the centers of power and influence of the Tambov group. It was led by the criminal Vladimir Kumarin, who is known as "Kumarik", and was one of the most powerful and violent bandits in St. Petersburg. The Tambov group controlled many different spheres of activity, such as illegal alcohol and drug business, organized raiding of real estate and many others.
Members of gangster groups, especially the Tambov gang, regularly gathered in bars and clubs on Rubinstein Street to discuss their cases, make decisions and coordinate their actions. Such meetings often took place in well-known establishments such as "Bourgeois", "Club 30-31", "Millimeter", "Indigo" and many others.
In addition, numerous crimes took place on Rubinstein Street, such as robberies, fraud, robberies and even murders. The proximity to nightlife and the large flow of people made this street an attractive target for criminals, especially in the dark hours of the night.

    <string name="place_desc_6">You are on Ligovsky Prospekt. Ligovka is the unofficial name of a district in St. Petersburg, which is used colloquially and is often found in fiction. This name comes from one of the main arteries of the district — Ligovsky Prospekt. Historically, the area was famous for its industry and the working class. Over time, it became one of the most densely populated areas of the city and, as a result, attracted various kinds of activities, including criminal ones.
Ligovka\'s connection with bandit Petersburg lies in the fact that in the post-Soviet period of the 1990s, when Russia was experiencing a surge in organized crime and the law of force, this area, like many others in St. Petersburg, became involved in territorial and criminal showdowns between various criminal groups. The Ligovskaya gang was one of the famous criminal groups of that time. The culture of "thieves in law", authorities and gangster clans often conducted their activities in areas like Ligovka, where it was possible to find places for backstage meetings, as well as recruit new members from local youth.
Gangs fought for control of shadow markets such as drug trafficking, extortion, illegal gambling and other criminal activities. Residents of the area found themselves between two fires: on the one hand, they had to adapt to the dominance of bandits over the area, and on the other, they suffered from corruption and the inability of law enforcement agencies to prevent violence and crime.
A lot of time has passed since then, and the "gangster Petersburg" of the 1990s has gone down in history, giving way to strengthening law and order and normalizing life in the city. The modern Ligovsky district, although it has retained some features of the former difficult past, has significantly transformed and has become a safer and more comfortable place for its residents to live and work.
